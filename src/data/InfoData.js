    "A vibrant and tough 9-year-old living in Stockholm Sweden. Emmi is driven and likes to entertain. She is used to be on stage and in front of the camera due to her work experience and performances in her leisure time activities. One of her most dominant traits is that she is highly social and easily adapts to new situations, she is as comfortable to play football with the boys as well as hang out with the girls in school. Emmi is more or less fluent in spoken English and has worked with the French fashion magazine Milk without any difficulties. Her leisure activities include theater lessons at Calle Flygare, dance/sing/theater lessons at Base23Â´s musical orientation classes and dancing lessons at Kulturskolan. She can also play some piano.",
